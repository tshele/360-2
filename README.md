#Getting Started

To get started with bulding the app, download the repository and open it in one of your favourite IDE's. I used Visual Studio Code. In Visual Studo you need to add the extension 'live-server' and run the app in the browser. However the app can be run as an Android or  iOS app. 

If you want to run the app as n Android or iOS app, follow the instructions of converting this web app to a mobile phone app on my repository "Convert a website to a mobile app" that is https://www.github.com/tshele/convert-a-website-to-a-mobile-app.
